# Trajectory Tracking for the Ballbot using Optimal Control

### Course Project for 16748: Underactuated Robotics at CMU

Tested using MATLAB R2018a 64-bit

For the planar model which plans in one dimension only, run `openloop_trajplan.m` in `planar` folder

For the 3D model which plans trajectory in both X and Y dimensions, run `openloop_trajplan3D.m` in `3d` folder
